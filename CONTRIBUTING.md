## How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! It is a goal of this project to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## This project's codebase uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/GabrielDuarteM/spark-mediamanager/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/GabrielDuarteM/spark-mediamanager/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and to follow the bug report template (the one that shows when you open a new bug).
People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* **Check if the feature was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/GabrielDuarteM/spark-mediamanager/issues).

* If you're unable to find an issue addressing the feature, [open a new one](https://github.com/GabrielDuarteM/spark-mediamanager/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, along with the current and expected behavior.

* If the sugestion recieved a positive feedback, you can start writing code.

## Will you submit new code?

* Don't forget to run `yarn build:ci`, to make sure it will pass our CI build. Commits that doesn't pass the ci build cannot be accepted.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Feel free to ask, opening a [new Github issue](https://github.com/GabrielDuarteM/spark-mediamanager/issues/new).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
